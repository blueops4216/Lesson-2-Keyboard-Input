/* A Dumb Calculator
 * 
 * Make a simple numeric calculator. It should prompt the user for three numbers.
 * Then add the numbers together and divide by 2. Display the result. Your program
 * must support numbers with decimals and not just integers.
 *
 * What is your first number? 1.1
 * What is your second number? 2.2
 * What is your third number? 5.5
 * 
 * ( 1.1 + 2.2 + 5.5 ) / 2 is... 4.4
